1. operating system concepts - your background - which 
   is typically electronics !!! theory part 
      - lot of reading and analysis
      - read class notes
      - read references
      - professional papers/documents
             - conference papers published on upcoming technologies !!!
                   - a theory part 
                   - implementation / practicals !!!

2. operating system related programming and implementation
   details !!! practical part 
      - assignments
      - lab time 
      - consolidate your understanding
      - pick up your skills !!!


3. most concepts and techniques will be new(common case - exceptions
                                            do occur  !!!)

    - class notes and teacher 
    - good references  

4. all modules are related and linked - initial modules
   are linked to advanced modules - act as base or foundation !!
    - each teacher will teach a module or 2 - responsibility 
      is with respective modules 
    - connecting the modules is the responsibility of the
      students !!! 
    - complaints :
            - i am new to programming - high-level languages
                     sequential programming  - practice !!!
            - i am new to os related programming - 
                     concurrent programming 
            - combining h/w and s/w interactions in programming
                  - 8-bit processors
                  - 32-bit processors - ARM processors 
                         - Linux is very popular in ARM processors
                              - os concepts
                              - C/C++ programming
                              - assembly 
                              - Linux programming
                              - Linux drivers/system programming 
                              - ????
                   - h/w platform knowledge - buses/device controllers 
                   - you need certain micro level details and
                     certain macro level details !!!        
5. how to gain proper skills and clear knowledge - related problems???
            - speed / pace of the course !!!! 16hrs per day !!!
            - never miss a class/lab 
            - clear class notes along with references/texts 
            - analysis 
            - complete your assignments 
            - interact with the teacher to clear doubts and 
              note down the details !!!
                   - completing your reading
                   - after attempting your assignments !!
            - document everything and read your documents !!
            - do your project sincerely !!!
                 - most students are not capable of doing projects !!!
                 - take up a small part of a larger project 
                   and do it properly !!!

6. Divesd specifics!!!
     - a pci chip set !!!
     - who will use it ???
            - a computing system !!!
                - may be embedded or may not be !!!
            - which component of the computing system will be 
              controlling and managing the pci controller ??
                   - I/O subsystem of the OS and respective 
                     drivers !!!
                      - how will they do it ???
                           - this will be learnt when you learn
                             about I/O subsystems and device drivers !!!
                           - you need not learn OS concepts and 
                             programming - please come to drivers
                             sessions after one month !!!
