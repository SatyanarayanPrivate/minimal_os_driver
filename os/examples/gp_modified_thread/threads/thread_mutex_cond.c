//in this example, we are using mutexes and condition variables to 
//  implement a message queue in user space - 2 threads are 
//  accessing the message queue,
//  in user-space - thread2 is producer thread and thread1 is 
//    the consumer thread both have to take of data exchange, 
//  synchronization and critical section !!!
//Note: after understanding and testing this example,
//      complete the same by replacing condition variables
//      with 2 semaphores - observe what is the difference !!!
