Let’s start near the end of the file with the parport_init() function. The first thing
the driver must do is gain exclusive access to the relevant I/O ports. That’s done with
the function request_region(), which returns a non-NULL value if it succeeds. The
arguments to request_region() are a base port number, the number of ports to al-
locate and the name of the device.


struct resource * 	request_region  (unsigned long start, unsigned long n, const char *name)
Allocate I/O port region.

struct resource * 	request_mem_region (unsigned long start, unsigned long n, const char *name)
Allocate I/O memory region.

void 	release_region (unsigned long start, unsigned long n)
Release I/O port region.
